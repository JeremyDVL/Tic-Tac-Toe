## <ins>What it does

The Bored List gives you a list of things to do when you are bored.  It is built with REACT and the data is pulled from the bored api http://www.boredapi.com/api/activity using fetch.

## <ins>How to Run

Clone Repo into editor => Open terminal in VS Code or other editor => run "npm start" for live server

  Once installed it will start you with one activity you can do.  Click the "Load Another" button to load another activity.  Click the "Reset" button to reset the list.

## <ins>Future improvements

I am pretty happy with this one although some improvements could be to add a number input and have the app generate the list based on the number assigned.  You could also filter based off interest.  I would like to know how to filter out the duplicates but have not figured that out yet.
